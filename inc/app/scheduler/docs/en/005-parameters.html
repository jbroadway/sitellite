<h1>Command Line Parameters</h1>

<p>In addition to the default way of calling the scheduler, you can
include additional parameters on the command line to control which
tasks are run.&nbsp; The two methods of specifying tasks are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Specify a single task to run, and only that task will be run.</li>
  <li>Specify one or more tasks to skip, and all tasks except those will be run.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following are examples of these two methods:</p>

<pre># run the scanner task only
php -f index scheduler-app scanner

# run all tasks except the scanner and documents tasks
php -f index scheduler-app -scanner -documents
</pre>
