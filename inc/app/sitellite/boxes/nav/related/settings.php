"<table border=\"0\"></table>") is unfortunately not;   possible.;; - Do not remove or alter in any way the first and last lines of this;   file.  They are in place for security reasons, and changing them will;   compromise the security of your web site by potentially displaying;   the contents of this file anonymous visitors to your web site.;; Content requirements:;; - This file contains configuration information pertaining to our box.;; - Required options are 'name', 'version', 'path', 'description',;   'author', and 'parameters'.  If there is more than one author,;   separate their names with a comma and a space.  The parameters value;   is a list of parameters that this box may accept.  Otherwise, go nuts.;   These four options must fall under the [Meta] section.  We recommended;   that you put box-specific options under a different section, such as;   [Custom].;[Meta]name			= Section Navigationversion			= 1.0path			= inc/boxes/sitellite/nav/relateddescription		= Creates either a list of section links or related links, depending on where you are within the site hierarchy.author			= John Luxford <john.luxford@gmail.com>parameters		= none;; THE END;; DO NOT ALTER THIS LINE, IT IS HERE FOR SECURITY REASONS */ ?>
