  should aid in allowing editors to see that the page has a new pending
  change, and to view it without having to go through the edit form to
  do so.

  which allows for significantly longer page bodies.  This change, in

- Section pages that are not top-level pages now show up correctly in the
  getSections() method of saf.GUI.Menu.
- Added new rules to saf.HTML.Messy to improve MS Word cleaning, and also
  to improve the cross-site scripting attack (XSS) protection in the parser.
  For XSS protection, the following new attributes are no longer allowed:
  dataformatas, data, datafld, datasrc, and dynsrc, and the following tags
  are now also stripped as well: applet, object, iframe, frame, frameset,
  layer, ilayer, embed, bgsound, link, meta, and xml, and any attribute
  with javascript:, vbscript:, or about: in it is stripped as well.
- Added body_parts property to global $page object, which breaks the page
  body into an array based on <hr /> tags in it.  This allows for multi-column
  and multi-part pages in a simple manner.
- Added OO interface to doing Javascript RPC requests based on the
  XMLHttpRequest object.  This is an extension to the existing js/rpc.js and
  saf.Misc.RPC packages, which allows for more powerful and complex RPC-based
  applications to be developed.
- Added children, siblings, and tree boxes to sitellite/nav/*.
- Added key bindings for undo/redo to Xed's multi-level history.

Changes in 4.0.14

- Added template, page_below, and page_alias properties to the news app.
- Added a new feature called tag binding to XT, and changed saf.Misc.Document
  to use it instead, eliminating several copy & paste tags from templates.
- Made the $saveas value in sitellite/util/pdfmaker false by default.
- Fixed newline issue affecting some documents with non-standard newline
  characters.
- Added id="sitellite-menu-current" to the current page's list item in
  saf.GUI.MenuItem
- Added error message display on PHPShorthand errors in XTE.
- Added auto-detection of section root to sitellite/nav/section box.
- Added defaulting of head_title and nav_title to normal title field.
- Added getBoxAccess() and getFormAccess() to saf.Loader, and fixed some
  other methods.  Also provided aliases loader_box_get_access() and
  loader_form_get_access().
- Added $page->addStyle() and page_add_style() to saf.Misc.Document.
- Fixed /js/rpc.js and saf.Misc.RPC to handle multi-line and HTML content
  in send and return values.
- Added default teams/all=rw in saf.Session.Manager to the user add form.
- If weight is unspecified for collections, they are now sorted secondarily
  in alphabetical order.
- Added function is_assoc() to saf.Functions.
- Added adminRoles() method and session_admin_roles() function to
  saf.Session.ACL.
- Forms can now be submitted by submit buttons from inside template widgets,
  but only when those buttons are listed in the template widget's
  submitButtons property.
- Fixed the saf.Misc.Search docs to refer to the template set modes.php files.
- Upgraded PHPUnit to 1.0.1.
- Silenced the error message when the 'Not Installed' tools fails to connect
  to simian.ca
- Added collection config settings order_by and sorting_order for specifying
  the default of both in the browse view.
- Fixed an error on the deleted items screen when viewing a collection without
  versioning.
- Default scheduler-app call now displays help instructions.
- Changed the default writer role to restrict him from writing to the queue
  (a way to bypass their inability to approve documents themselves).
- Fixed a bug that let you set a new password without verifying it in the
  user manager.
- Removed sitellite_tab_list table from install-mysql.sql, since it is not
  in use for anything.
- Fixed a mistake in the docs/REQUIREMENTS file.
- Added workflow triggers to the default add/edit forms, as well as for the
  Web Pages, Web Files, Sidebars, and News Stories collections (ie. all of the
  default collections).
- Fixed a bug in saf.Database.Generic's single() method -- thanks to Shane
  for the bug report.
- Added menu structure caching to the content server, which should improve
  the speed of sites with large numbers of pages.
- Added display_title field to Web Files collection.
- Added new class to SAF: saf.HTML.CSS_Parser -- a simple CSS parser that
  correctly handles most CSS cases, and allows you to easily extract
  information about any CSS data/file.
- Fixed rename ID of page error (#0000004) -- thanks to kozmoz for the fix!
- Fixed news browse view showing wrong date (#0000005) -- thanks to kozmoz for
  the fix!
- Fixed double-slash error in subdir installs (#0000007) -- thanks to kozmoz
  for the fix!
- Fixed missing site_prefix () references in imagechooser, default template
  set, and xed (#0000010) -- thanks to kozmoz for the fix!
- Fixed a bug in is_assoc() method in saf.Functions.
- Fixed a bug in saf.Session causing sitemember/register to fail.
- Fixed a bug in saf.Misc.Search causing search term highlighting to break
  existing HTML tags, such as links.  Also adds automatic highlighting of
  terms coming from the major search engines.  Thanks to kozmoz for the fix!
- Fixed a bug in SiteMember's list box causing names that don't start with A-Z
  not to display at all -- thanks to kozmoz for the fix!
- Fixed a bug causing news story comment notices to fail to be sent -- thanks
  to kozmoz for the fix!
- Fixed a bug in sitellite/nav/top causing the currently active drop menu to
  output incorrect HTML when dropmenus is on.
- Fixed a bug where the id and below_page field sizes weren't the same in the
  sitellite_page table.
- Added a new sorting weight field to the web pages, to allow control over the
  sorting of pages other than alphabetically.
- Added limit option to news/rss/viewer.
- Added new status of 'pending' to the existing list of default settings.

Changes in 4.0.13

- Added Owner and Team MailForm widget types.  The first is similar to the
  Info widget, except it defaults to session_username (), and the second
  displays either an Info field (if you're not allowed to change the team),
  or the teams you can change it to if you're the owner, or all teams if
  you're a master admin.
- Added an $alt field to saf.Date.Calendar.Simple, which fills an alternate
  title text for displaying on mouse hovers.
- Changed the web pages, news, sidebars, and web files collections to use
  the new Owner and Team widgets.
- Fixed a bug in saf.Ext.IXR -- thanks to Greg for the fix!
- Added error comments when XT include files contain syntax errors.  Thanks
  to Pat for the discovery!
- Added new database function db_pairs() which is ultra handy.  See
  http://www.sitellite.org/docs/ for more info.
- Added a check for the context of the news/rss/viewer box, and in 'action'
  context it displays the news feed's title.
- Added a new menu_get_sections() function and getSections() method to the
  saf.GUI.Menu package/class, which retrieves a list of sections of the site.
- Added a new property to the [browse:field_name] blocks in the Rex definition
  files: virtual.  The virtual property allows you to specify a filter that
  doesn't transform the value, but calculate an otherwise nonexistent value
  based on the object as a whole (for that row in the browse screen).  This
  is handy for doing things like statistical columns.
- htmlentities() is only called on field values with no filters in the browse
  view now.
- Fixed the sitemember account activation where sometimes it would fail due
  to a false value being sent instead of a null value.  Thanks to Pat for the
  discovery!
- Added sitellite_log table, cms/services/log box, and cms.Workflow class,
  which implements the ability to trigger services registered to occur on
  certain actions or document status transitions within the system.  Services
  are simply Sitellite boxes or forms, allowing a great deal of flexibility
  within them.  cms/services/log is registered as a default global service, as
  well as a default error service, so Sitellite now logs all actions
  automatically.  To add admin notices, simply write a quick
  mail('admin@example.com', 'wake up!', 'error: ' . $parameters['message'])
  box and add it to the error list in inc/app/cms/conf/services/error.php.
- Loader now checks for permissions on all contexts other than normal, not
  just action and inline any more.  This allows you to limit access to custom
  contexts in addition to the defaults.
- sitellite/sidebar now calls alias boxes with the 'sidebar' context.
  cms.Workflow::trigger() calls them with the context 'service'.  So there
  are now 5 built-in contexts: normal, inline, action, sidebar, and service.
- Added single() and shift() methods to saf.Database.Generic, mimicking the
  db_shift() and db_single() functions.
- Added the ability to pass an object or array to cms/buttons instead of
  specifying the id, status, access, and team properties individually.  The
  new parameter is named 'object'.
- cms/services/log has its own access.php file now, allowing it to be called
  from public actions as well, but not directly from the url (so people can't
  abuse it if they knew it was there).
- You can now use the ${path} syntax in box and form calls in XT.  Some of
  the XT class documentation has also been moved to a series of articles on
  sitellite.org now.

Changes in 4.0.12

- Minor bug fixes from 4.0.11

Changes in 4.0.11

- Added new function loader_call() to saf.Loader.  This allows you to load
  and call a method or function from a package in a single line of code,
  which is ideal for things like filling in the setValues = "eval: ..."
  values in a form settings file, or just shortening your code.
- Added the ability to specify the "eval: ..." line in Rex collection
  definition file [hint:field_name] sections.
- Removed the 'not empty' rule on the sidebar body field, eliminating the
  nag message when entering an alias to a box.
- Added a session_password() function to saf.Session for retrieving the
  encrypted form of the current user's password.  Also added a getUser()
  method to saf.Session, which wraps around the saf.Session.Source getUser().
- Added 5 new fields to sitellite_user: public, profile, sig, registered,
  and modified.  These allow you to specify whether a user should be publicly
  visible (in the case that you want a public user listing), a profile for
  that user (ie. a self-description), a signature for signing forum
  postings and things of that nature, and the date/time that a user was
  registered and last modified.
- Added a new SiteMember app, which provides standardized membership
  services to Sitellite, which before were spread out over the sitellite
  and org apps.  This includes built-in functions for user registration,
  password recovery, changing passwords and profiles, member listings
  (public only), member personal pages, member contact forms (public
  only), and the optional ability to allow member logins to be remembered
  across many visits to a site.
- Added user-contributed submissions to the news app, including boxes
  for displaying the submitted stories in the users' new home pages in
  SiteMember.

Changes in 4.0.10

- Fixed a bug where the 'disabled' value was showing up as 'Yes' for all
  users in the user browser.
- Fixed a bug causing the DevFiles settings to try to save to the DevNotes
  settings instead.  Thanks to Bob for the report!
- Added a new column, head_title, to sitellite_page, which allows you to
  specify an alternate page title for use in the <head><title></title></head>
  tag of an HTML document.  This can help with tailoring a web site for
  search engine optimization.
- Removed the "not empty" rule on the sitellite_page/title field.
- Fixed a bug where the title of pages with only a nav_title were showing
  up blank in the below_page ("Location in Web Site") select box.
- Fixed the permissions on uploaded files via the Web Files collection.
  They now use permissions 0774 (read/write by user and group, read by all).
- Added a {filter addslashes}{end filter} around the {intl ...} tags in the
  AppDoc translation builder, specifically when the tags appear within
  Javascript single-quotes, so that the single-quotes are not prematurely
  terminated by the output of the {intl ...} call.  If there are any other
  instances of {intl ...} within quoted strings in Javascript, they should
  always be wrapped with {filter addslashes}{end filter}.  I'll have to
  do a thorough walk-through of the translation strings to be sure.
- Fixed a bug where an empty radio button wouldn't allow forms to submit,
  even with no rules attached.  Thanks to Pat for the report!
- Changed the behaviour of page_below() so that it only affects the
  breadcrumb trails and not the rest of the navigation.  To affect the
  rest of the navigation, you should use a page alias to your app, and
  specify that alias within the app via page_id().  This allows better
  control over the navigation with respect to apps/dynamic page requests.
- Fixed a bug where cancelling the "Add Bookmark" prompt would add a "null"
  bookmark.
- Added proper parsing of form settings.php files to saf.I18n.Builder, as
  well as automatic calling of intl_get() on the proper elements contained
  therein by the parseSettings() method of MailForm.  Forms should now be
  fully I18n capable, including titles, messages, names, buttons, and
  validation rule messages.
- Revamped the style of the example site included in Sitellite.
- Revamped the style of the API docs templates, eliminated the use of frames
  as well.
- Fixed a bug in saf.XML.RSS.Simple and news/rss/viewer where it was only
  parsing certain types of RSS files (apparently there are two, one based
  on RDF, the other not, and the former places the <item> tags outside of
  the <channel> where the latter puts them inside instead).  Thanks to Jeff
  for the report!
- The MailForm Selector widget is now access aware, checking whether there's
  a resource defined by the name of the selector table, and whether the
  current user has access to it.

Changes in 4.0.9-rc

- I missed a few commits that were intended for 4.0.8.  Hey, it's Sunday,
  so technically I'm not even supposed to be working right now...

Changes in 4.0.8-rc

- Fixed XT template inclusion, so that when you call <xt:inc name="foo.tpl" />
  you don't have to specify the path, and the starting point is set to
  inc/html/{conf/default_template_set}/ for you.
- The $cgi->mode behaviour has changed.  For $cgi->mode itself, a bug in
  the new template layouts that caused the mode to always be set to 'html'
  was fixed.  The output mode is now also determined by two other values:
  $cgi->setMode, and session_get('output_mode').  If the $cgi->setMode is
  set, it takes precedence over $cgi->mode, and also calls session_set()
  to set the output_mode to its value.  Subsequent requests from that
  user can now omit $cgi->setMode and $cgi->mode, because it will be
  discovered from the session_get('output_mode') instead.  If $cgi->mode
  is set, it overrides session_get() but does not override $cgi->setMode.
  This gives developers the ability to change the output mode without
  having to pass around a $cgi->mode value to every page of that new
  mode, which is an error prone method anyway, but still allows the
  default mode or the mode of the current session, to be overridden on
  single screens in the same manner as before.
- Output modes can now automatically be given a proper HTTP content type
  header, using a modes.php file in the template set folder to specify
  the content type of each mode.  See the default template set for an
  example.
- Added saf.XML.RSS.Simple class, which retrieves an RSS news feed from
  another site (or from cache, caching is automatic) as an XMLDoc
  object structure, ready for you to parse it and display it.  This
  improves on the existing saf.XML.RSS package, which required XSLT
  support in PHP.
- Moved the news/rss/viewer box to using the new saf.XML.RSS.Simple
  package, since the code for it was essentially lifted from the existing
  news/rss/viewer anyway.
- Moved content filtering to the modes.php file in each template set.
  That way you can specify filters for specific modes only, and now also
  for additional fields, not just the page body.
- Added automatic field length validation to saf.Database.Table, as well
  as to key fields in the web pages and sidebars collections.
- Added a new MailForm rule "numeric" which allows you to easily verify
  whether a field value is numeric or not.
- Added a new field, nav_title, to the Web Pages, allowing you to specify
  a separate title in your navigation than in the page itself.
- Fixed a bug in saf.GUI.Pager so that now it properly obeys the $maxPages
  value in the pre-made PAGER_TEMPLATE_PAGE_LIST template.
- Added cms/filesystem/rss action so that file download lists can also be
  easily syndicated.
- Fixed a bug that was causing cms/filesystem downloads to sometimes fail.
- Added a custom rule to the Web Files collection, ensuring that a file
  extension is always present (required by the Rex Filesystem source driver).
- Various bug fixes in saf.Database.NestedSet, including the completion of
  the delete(), move(), and rename() functions.  This class is now feature-
  complete and ready for use in the sitellite_page table in 4.1.0 (next
  development release).
- Added saf/lib/Database/NestedSet/shell.php, which is an interactive shell
  for querying and testing the NestedSet package.  And it's pretty fun too!
- Added "Clear table" option, as well as the ability to drop or clear
  multiple tables at once, in the DB Manager.
- Fixed a few bugs in the access control of the browse and deleted items
  screens.
- Extended the length of the sitellite_page id field to 72 characters, so
  that people can add extra keywords to their urls to improve their search
  engine relevance.
- Fixed a bug in MailForm's createWidget() method that caused setValue and
  setDefault not to work in settings.php files.
- Added the ability to control the look of the news app paging links in
  two ways: 1) the style, either a standard pager, previous/next links with
  the headers from the respective pages, or header links from each page, and
  2) location, either the top of the story, the bottom, or both.
  Thanks to Amnon for the suggestion!
- Added proper referencing of <label> with checkboxes and radio buttons.
  Thanks to Didier for that!
- SimpleRSS fetch() now returns an object reference like it's supposed to.
- Fixed a looping bug in XT.
- Updated saf.I18n and saf.I18n.Builder to handle .spt templates and the
  intl_get() function properly.
- Started adding translation capabilities to AppDoc, which will be what
  supersedes the old Translation Builder app.  Also allows you to translate
  strings from your global templates.  Still to do: test with lots of
  languages! :)
- Updated the I18n negotation to include the languages from an individual
  app (automatically) when an app, box, or form is requested.  This way,
  apps can define additional languages that will be added to the list of
  possibilities while you're in that app (before, you'd have to define
  all languages in the global list).

Changes in 4.0.7-rc

- Fixed a few bugs in the Session package, especially a timeout issue
- Sessions now expire after an hour instead of a half an hour (which was
  due to the above bug)
- Increased the alias field length to 255 in the sitellite_sidebar table
- Added rpc_decode() to the rpc.js package, because rpc_response() now
  converts double quotes and angle braces into entities, and rpc_decode()
  converts them back.
- Updated the inc/conf/version.php file to reflect the new version (forgot
  to do that for 4.0.6) -- thanks to Greg Ferguson for the head's up!
- Copied inc/app/cms/html/facets.spt to inc/app/usradm/html/facets.spt and
  changed Rex's renderFacets() to call the facets.spt or facets_twocols.spt
  that is within the current app.  This fixes an intermittent bug where
  the user manager facets wouldn't render.
- Admin can no longer delete the role or team that they belong to.  Now
  results in an alert message.
- Fixed the ordering of sidebar items in the example site (default
  installation).
- Fixed an incorrect index definition on the sitellite_property_set table.
- Changed sitellite_property_set's data_value column to type text instead
  of char(255), which will make it more useful for a wider range of
  applications (even simple caching of syndicated content...).  Also increased
  the length of the other three columns to 84.
- Added news/rss/viewer box, which syndicates content headlines in RSS format
  from external web sites.  This can be called as a sidebar or anywhere else.
  Uses saf.Database.PropertySet to handle caching of news feeds as serialized
  SloppyDOM objects. :)
- Fixed a bug in MailForm's setValues handling which caused comma-separate
  values in settings.php files not to be properly parsed in some cases.
- Added eqq and neq aliases for === and !==, respectively, to
  saf.Misc.Shorthand.
- Updated template preview button in web page add/edit forms to point to the
  proper directory structure now.
- Added new packages to SAF, saf.Date.Calendar.Mini, which implements a
  mini calendar renderer called MiniCal, and saf.Date.Calendar.Simple, which
  implements a simple monthly calendar renderer (with much less hassle, but
  also less customizability, than saf.Date.Calendar).  Both MiniCal and
  SimpleCal are setlocale()-aware, however calendars always begin on Sundays.
  Both also provide a control of all aspects of the UI via CSS.
- Fixed javascript error in cms_cancel() function.
- Default add and edit forms now use the "Collection, singular" name if
  available, instead of "Item", to refer to the document being created/edited.
  For example, adding a news story it might print "Adding Story" instead of
  "Adding Item".
- Added [Server][content_filters] option to inc/conf/config.ini.php, to allow
  configurable, and multiple, functions to transform content from pages before
  they are sent to the XT templates.  This is how search term highlighting is
  handled now.
- help-app now checks for inc/app/$app/docs/en instead of just /docs, so that
  it ensures there are actually docs available, before listing them in the
  application list.
- Fixed a bug where "anonymous" was coming up as a role in both the user and
  role editing screens, or else it was coming up as a blank option in the
  role selection boxes.
- Fixed a bug where Web Files was not changing the folder of the file unless
  you also entered a new name (or re-typed the name into the text box).
- Added an <xt:code> tag to XT, allowing you to output literal PHP code that
  is not evaluated (for example, if you wanted to publish a static site with
  PHP, but wanted to still include _some_ dynamic pieces -- ie. you wanted
  Sitellite for content management, but something custom for content serving).
  An optional highlighted="yes" attribute will run it through the
  highlight_string() function, which is useful for outputting example code.
  Another optional attribute language="php" allows you to change the opening
  and closing tags, to allow for output in different languages.  Possible
  values are php (<?php ?>), asp (<% %>), jsp (<% %>), javascript (<script
  language="javascript"></script>), runat_server (<script runat="server">
  </script> wrapper), asp_include (<%@ %>), jsp_include (<%@ %>), eperl
  (<: :>), and eruby (<% %>), and python (<% %>).  The reason for the
  duplicates is so that you don't have to write, say, python code, and
  call it asp.  Note that if highlighted="yes", XT doesn't care what
  language you chose, it's outputting formatted PHP.
- Added folder and file type facets to the Web Files browse screen, so you
  can limit the list of files to a specific folder (a staple of all file
  managers), as well as by file type (file extension), or any combination
  of those two and the other facets (text search, status, and access level).
  Powerful stuff.
- Fixed a bug in Rex's getList() and getStoreList() functions that wasn't
  properly setting the conditions when multiple calls to different collections
  where being made in the same page request.
- Fixed a bug with the scheduler's "documents" task, which publishes queued
  documents and archives expired ones, based on the sitellite_startdate and
  sitellite_expirydate fields.
- Fixed a bug where allowed access levels and statuses weren't appearing in
  the select boxes on add & edit screens, due to a 'rw' where read had been
  set to 'all' for the user, and write was only set on specific values.
  The fix makes read implied in write, since you need to see the values in
  the list to select them. :)
- Added sitellite_filesystem to the resource list.

Changes in 4.0.6-rc

- Added a workaround to a known PHP bug ("Problem with method call") that
  affected some systems
- Made Site/usedocroot setting work, and added Site/prefix setting as well
- Added array_chunk() and array_change_key_case() functions for PHP 4.1
  compatibility
- Added xmlentities() function
- Cleaned up saf.Functions documentation
- Merged pix, css, and inc/html folders into one coherent "template set"
  structure (like themes).  Also introduced the page_template_set() function
  and the access.php sitellite_template_set setting.
- SiteSearch checking in news/search and sitellite/search now looks for pid
  file, not just the sitesearch directory.
- Fixed a few drop menu bugs.
- Added "form hints" to the collection definition format.  These are like
  the MailForm settings.php files, except they pertain to the rendering of
  Rex collections in the CMS default add/edit screens.  This solves one of
  the main remaining missing features from Sitellite 3, and finally makes
  Rex collections as equally configurable as the old table configurations.
- Added DATE, TIME, and DATETIME as constants in the SAF init scripts.  This
  is handy in form configurations for setting default values in date widgets.
- Fixed a bug in the new template structure regarding templates of section
  pages resolving for child pages.
- Added page_get_section() function, handy for doing logic based on sections
  (ie. alternating graphics), by being able to determine which section a
  page is in.
- Added saf.Database.PropertySet class.
- Fixed a bug when specifying alternate ports in saf.Database.
- Added createWidget() to take ini settings and create widgets in MailForm.
- Added ability to pass PHP expressions to setValues in settings.php files,
  like this: setValues = "eval: formdata_get ('myapp_fieldname')".
- Made sure all fields referring to the username are 48 characters long,
  especially sitellite_owner and sv_author fields.
- Added Dir::fetch() and Dir::getStruct() to saf.File.Directory.
- Fixed bugs with cms.Versioning.Rev.Store.Database::getDeleted() and the
  cms-deleted-items-action script.
- Various fixes added to better handle renaming within Rev/Rex.
- New "Web Files" collection for managing online files.
- Added an exec()-based version of mime_content_type() for those of us
  without --with-mime-magic, used by the cms-filesystem-action script.
- Added "sitesearch" facet to Rex facet types, which means SiteSearch can
  now be integrated seamlessly into the Sitellite control panel browse
  screen with a simple:
    [facet:search]
    display = Search
    type = sitesearch
- Added page_is_parent() function.
- Made the title field optional for sitellite_sidebar.

Changes in 4.0.5-beta

- Numerous bug fixes.
- Added messaging UI
- Minor API enhancements
- Implemented the privilege system throughout Sitellite now, not just at API
  level but in the UI too (for example, logging in as a writer you'll see a
  disabled drop menu and greyed out icons for the admin tools).
